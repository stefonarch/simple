# Plain Widget styled LXQt theme

Difference from system theme:
   
* No double border frames in menus
* Margins in Main menu search results, kbindicator
* Styled runner size  and notification popup colors
* *.svg files in between dark and bright

Issue: text in taskbar buttons is still centered in widget styles "breeze" and "oxygen", Kvantum engine works.
